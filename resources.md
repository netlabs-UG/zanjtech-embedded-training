# ZanjTech Resources

Some curated sources of stuff I personally came across as impactful and full of knowledge or encouragement in engineering computer systems. It should be of note that computer engineering is a field that augments and improves other areas of human life; it's typical that for any system made that involves computer design, the outcome of it's use is to improve another domain. So as you'll notice, some of these(especially edutainment), use a lot of examples of their design for other fields.

*Also note that almost all of these aren't built by Africans, I've not found or been around many African-based channels, so I'm not sure of their existence. I don't suppose that's a problem though.*

### Youtube Channels
- [Stuff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1VqrHhDte54oLgPG4xpuQ) - For engineering development process videos. He also has a second channel called *Stuff Made Here 2* where he does some teardown of the Form 4 3D printer. Very good to see how they explain the choices made. He's a mechanical design engineer.
- [Digikey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCclJCqMDAkyVGsm5oFOTXIQ) - For **electronics** next-step intro videos. Especially Shawn Hymel's series. Check his series on KiCad, and Yocto(if/when you get there).
- [Real Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IuLEqb6UEA_zQ81kwXfg) - For auto engineering and design choices and thinking in military and general engineering.
- [EEVBlog](https://www.youtube.com/@EEVblog) - Electronics engineering blog made by a guy with a lot of real world experience, delivering content that directly fills the gap unfilled by the transition from theory to **professional**(beyond just practice).

### Social Groups and Channels
*Discord:*
- [Embedded Engineering Amulius](https://discord.gg/embedded) - Probably the most resource rich embedded engineering community I know.

*Telegram:*
- [Russian Embedded group](t.me/proembedded) - ***Language : Russian, Very Likely not for beginners*** -  Highly unlikely that you'll use this if you have little experience or tolerance for non-English speakers, but this group has a lot of skilled engineers discussing topics in embedded, and they welcome English speakers asking questions or speaking in their language. Might be better if you use a translator though, if you want more people to chip in.
- [Python Talk](t.me/python_talk) - Hard to get in group that has a small but really good group of python engineers. Most conversations are advanced though, not too useful beyond giving you a heads up on what's out there, the devs are getting old, busy and less active, and you'll probably only get in if you have some good python experience
### Good GitHub Resources

- "*Awesome*" git repositories. You can ask Grok/ChatGPT to help you find some of these. I've left one good one below:
	- https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners

### Generally good websites

Programming:
- [Codewars](codewars.com) - Good coding challenges when you're bored and want to hone your skills in thinking in a language, getting ideas for writing cool shorter programs for a task, faster algorithm choices and idiomatic code, by doing and reading other people's solutions
- [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org) - Website with a lot of very well prepared beginner tutorials on most technology. I rarely come here directly, and usually a Google search or youtube video finds me the content.
- [Coursera](coursera.org) - Has some good courses on technical topics taught by professionals or academics with tons of experience or at least skill at passing on information on their topic.
- [Embedded Online Conference](embeddedonlineconference.com) - Online embedded (**paid**) conference, sometimes they have free talks from the old legends of the embedded field; It's from the makers of **EmbeddedRelated.com** below.
- [Embedded Related](embeddedrelated.com) - A blog about embedded development, which has a whole host of sibling sites around electronics development like <https://FPGARelated.com>, <https://DSPRelated.com>, and <https://electronics-related.com>.
- [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io) - Very good hardware hackers community(probably the biggest I know). Has very good inspirational projects for hardware development.
