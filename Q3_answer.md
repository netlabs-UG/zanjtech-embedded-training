RISC-V 	is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture. This promotes individuals to design and build custom processors for free without paying for license fees to other companies such as Intel and ARM
This in turn improves research and innovations among people as well as encouraging collaboration among different teams.
RISC-V being open-source makes it free to use hence reducing dependence on the few manufacturers such as Intel.
