RISCV is a free and open standard instruction set architecture taht usees a Reduced Instruction Set(RISC) philosphy.

Risc allows one to design and manufacture ans sell RISC-V, based processors without paying fees for licensing. This enables new or startup manufacturers of processing chips/processors to do it freely without worry of copyright infrigement or adverse consequences. This inturn promotes innovation among startups in vaious embedded systems and Ai sectors especially in developing countries

Additionally this means one does not need a lot of financial capital to start to develop such processing chips which could put a burden on and discourage potential innovators

-also RISCV is simple and efficient to use and can complete tasks effectively
