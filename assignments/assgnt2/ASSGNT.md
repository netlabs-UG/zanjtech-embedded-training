# QUESTIONS 
1. Name at least 10 chip designers for embedded electronics (embedded chips - microcontrollers)
2. Name at least 4 chip fabricators in the world (at least one in Europe, one in America)
3. Why do you or other people think RISCV is important in the world? (at least 50-100 words)
   - Reduced Instruction Set Computing â€“ Version 5, is important because it is an open-source instruction set architecture, which means anyone can use, modify, or build processors based on it for free. This encourages innovation and allows people to design custom chips that meet specific needs. It is easy to learn, adapt, and improve.
